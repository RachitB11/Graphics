Code was written in Windows 8.1 in Qt Creator 5.6.0 and QMake Version 3.0

NOTE: Require Qt Creator to run the GUI. Will be updating the folder with the .exe of the application in future iterations.

Build and run the project in Qt Creator to display the GUI.
Use the File menu to open object and camera files and save images displayed in the QLabel.
Use the spin boxes to alter the camera parameters.
Use the radio buttons to switch between the different shading options.
Use the check boxes to try diferent image processing options.
Each time you make a change in the settings, please  click the 'Rasterize / Re-rasterize' button to display the result on the QLabel.
